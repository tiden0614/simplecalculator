# Simple Calculator
A boring calculator that I use to learn programming for iOS

There is a built-in parser that can evaluate arithmetic expressions typed (well, toched) by the user

For example, the calculator can successfully evaluate something like "-cos(3.14) / (56 + 23) * 4 - 6 * sqrt(9)"

Parsing errors are yet to be added to the parser
